bootloader:
	the bootloader has bootsignature at the 2nd last byte. It is two bytes long. Boot signature or boot checksum
	is 0xaa55. the bootloader executes commands in real mode. prepares the environment for 32 bit kernel.
	uzi has a bootloader that loads a loader program into memory. loader program is the second stage bootloader.
	loader program loades our 32 bit kernel.

	bpb: bios parameter block starts 3 bytes from the start memory 0x7c00. 3 bytes long 'jmp to bootstrap'
		instruction. then 11 bytes long OEM name in text. followed by bpb description which 25 bytes long.
		then follows 26 bytes long extended bpb if there is one.
	bootstrap: aka bootcode. after the bpb, next what follows is the bootcode. which can be of length 448.
			lengthOfBootCode=(512-2 bytes bootsignature-bpbLength).
